All for's in while.

Array : It is the collection of similar datatypes.

a[2][2][2]
[] : is set  # in between these all are subsets
[] : is row
[] : is column

Joining Rule : for joining there should be one column with same datatype in both the tables.

sql functions
sys defined   single row &    
              date & time   
              string        
              numeric       
              system

Normalization
1NF :  Primary Key
2NF : 1NF and No Partial Dependency
3NF : 1NF, 2NF and No transitive dependency(indirect dependencies)
    Partial : many keys to one non key `   attribute
    transitive : non key attribute to non key attribute

Matplotlip is python library to manage graphs in python.

cluster : Pre defined 
and non cluster index : 

Data preprocessing : When we make raw data into uselful data, this process is called data preprocessing.
Machine Learning works on numeric data and Independent Data.

Datatype in Machine Learning : Numeric and Catogerial
    Numeric : integer and float
    Categorial : Nominal(Cannot be indexed) and Ordinal(can go upto 7)

fit_transform() : categorial data into array of numbers

**Level_Encoding in Scikit-Learn

Extract numerical and categorical column from dataset

Machine Learning :
    Supervised : Input and Output both are known.
    Unsupervised : Only Input in known.
    Semisupervised :
